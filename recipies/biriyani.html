</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Wash and soak basmati rice for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. Soaking rice helps remove the excess starch from the rice and makes it more fluffy.</li>
    <li>Grind ginger, garlic, coriander leaves, mint leaves to a smooth puree and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil+ghee in a pressure cooker. Add in bay leaf or in my case I used pandan leaf in the oil and let them sizzle. Now add in sliced onions and fry till golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add in ground ginger garlic herb paste and saute for 5 minutes till raw smell leaves and the colour changes.</li>
    <li>Add in chopped tomatoes and cook till it gets soft.</li>
    <li>Add in biryani masala powder. If you don't have biryani masala powder, use 1 tbsp chilli powder, 2 tbsp coriander powder, 1 tsp turmeric powder and 2 tsp garam masala powder.</li>
    <li>Mix the spice powder into the masala. Stir fry for few seconds.</li>
    <li>Add in your vegetables mixture. I used a mix of carrots, cauliflower, green peas, beans.</li>
    <li>Stir fry the vegetables in the masala for 4 to 5 minutes till raw smell leaves.</li>
    <li>Add in soaked basmati rice and mix to combined. Stir fry the rice with vegetables for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in water. Season the biryani with salt.</li>
    <li>Add in Â½ tsp sugar, lemon juice and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
    <li>Mix everything, bring it to a boil.</li>
    <li>Cover and pressure cook for 1 whistle. Turn off the flame, let the pressure release by itself.</li>
    <li>Now the rice is cooked.</li>
    <li>Heat ghee in a small pan, add cashews and fry till golden brown.</li>
    <li>Pour the fried nuts into biryani and mix well.</li>
    <li>Veg biryani ready to serve. Enjoy.</li>
